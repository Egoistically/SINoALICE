# Stuff to do with the il2cpp library
* `script.py` - Script to automatically replace game's il2cpp with the selected one, **requires root**. Tested with rooted BlueStacks 4.230.10 (use BSTweaker to root it).
* `sigpatcher.py` - Script to automatically patch given signatures/patterns, wildcard is `??`. Tested with arm32, don't know if it works with arm64.
