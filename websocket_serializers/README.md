# Websocket Serializer
Python serializer for Quests' `SystemScheduleInfo` event. Can be integrated with my [websocket script](https://github.com/Egoistically/SINoALICE/blob/master/mitmproxy/mitm_websocket.py) for mitmproxy.  
  
Disclaimer:
* Haven't checked thoroughly for possible type errors/improvements.
* The game uses the same sort of hardcoded serialization, therefore, a future update may break it.
* Not responsible for its use and or misuse, do what you want with it.
  
Made and tested on Python `3.7.9`.
